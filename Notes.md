# Invitation

You are receiving this text because you have won at least one of the 97 other games of Catan that I've played over the last year. I've been planning a big party for my 100th game. What I have so far: 

## Groups

### Group 1
Andrew Oliver, Charlie Livaudais, Noah Pritt, Chris Maynard

### Group 2
 Mackenzie Zepeda, Avishek Khan, Patrick Bowers, Saige Sunier

### Group 3
Philipp Popp, Milla Shin, Tanya Riordan, Stuart Baker

### Group 4
Beth Schulman, Craig Fiedorek, Janice Liu, Jacob Leiken/Hannah Chow


## Outline
1. Each Group must have one member who advances to the final round
    1. This will be settled by speed catan, where each turn must end within 1 minute.
    1. Intution: Catan games usually average around 60-70 turns, estimating for about an hour for completion
    1. 100 shots of white claw/5.5 drinks must be consumed by the end of this first game
1. Final Round: 
    1. Avishek
    1. Top 3 from Groups 1-4

## Schedule 
- 7:00 PM - Arrive, Name Tags, Begin Drinking

# TODO
I know it will be difficult to get all 16 of you in one place at one time but I really want to try. Please fill out this survey so I can figure out a good time for everyone :)

# FAQ
- Name Tags? 
Yup! Everyone will receive a NFC-programmed nametag upon entry. It will have a picture of the time you won/played catan with me. When you tap it on your phone, I will have your player stats pulled up that has all the dates and notes of the games you have won when we played together. It will also be an integral part of the party: right now I have plans for: 
    - Using a board creator that will automatically push to your nametag at the start of each round
    - We will be playing a background drinking game called Don't Get Got

- Awards? 
There will be a trophy for the 4 games in Game 99 and one big trophy for Game 100 (my hydroflask for reference). Nametags are yours to keep too as a souvenir from the party. 

- Feedback? 
Taking it all! Text me if you have any ideas (425)-876-9502

- I'm nervous about playing with people I don't know 
Don't worry, there are no friends in Catan.
